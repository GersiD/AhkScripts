# AhkScripts

A small repo for accessing my AHK keybindings across machines.
Comes pre-packaged with a replace script which kills running instances and replaces them for quick editing and deployment.

# Installation

Install AHK first (I just use the most recent version)

# Usage

```
.\replaceAhkScript.ps1
```
